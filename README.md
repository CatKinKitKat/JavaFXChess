# JavaFXChess

A JavaFX Chess game made for the end stage of my PO2 (OOP; Object Oriented Programming) course as the second project.

== Description

This simple JavaFX (JDK8) app is just a MVC app. Which satisfies the condition of a chess game, has undo and redo, saves game state onto a file adn maybe more (it has been quite some time).
